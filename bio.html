&#9785;Scattered thoughts. Me?&#9786;;</font>
</h2>
I was born Christian O'Neal McMillan, 1997, January 11th. Since a child I have had a mind that wandered.<br />
As I aged I began to question everything around me and never took anything at face value.<br />
If you see something in a particular light, I'm trying to turn the light off and feel it out.<br />
This has always been my mindset. 
I found my first passion as a freshman in highschool, music, specifically hip hop.<br />
Since then I've immersed myself in the culture, current and previous generations.<br />
My junior year I decided to start making music on my own. Thats when I started writing songs <br />
that werent just pointless words that rhyme, it was a start. 
A year later I became interested with <br />
mixing my own vocals and audio.
This year I started producing, making the whole thing from scartch all by myself.
